Project: covid-19 impact on stock transaction
Abstract: Our study aims to evaluate the performance of several time-series models on Amazon stock prices during the COVID-19 period, including ARIMA, Regression, and GARCH, using insights derived from the 
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). The core objective is to identify the most effective model for capturing the dynamic and often unpredictable movements of Amazon's stock. 
Our findings reveal that the ARMA(0,0)xGARCH(1,1) model with a t-distribution emerges as the superior model, achieving the AIC of -5.1178, demonstrating a robust ability to capture the volatility inherent in the stock's price movements.
